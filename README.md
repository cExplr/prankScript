# rm-rf
---

A BASH prank that shows their files being deleted

Make sure you have permission to run this program.\
If not, you may have to change the permission if you have the chance to if you are fortunate enough

```shell

$ sudo chmod +x rm-rf 

```

### PLEASE MAKE SURE TO ENTER THE CORRECT FILE NAME BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT TO END UP ACCIDENTALLY DELETE THE ENTIRE FILE SYSTEM IN THE TARGET's SYSTEM

##### TO RUN THIS PROGRAM

You can choose to move it to some where which appear to have lots of files and directories and running the program with AS MANY HORRIFYING LOOKING ARGUMENTS
AT THE END OF THE FILE LIKE

```shell

$ ./rm-rf * -d all

```

The key thing to run is just

```shell

$ ./rm-rf

```

And the arguments at the back are optional!

HAVE FUN!
